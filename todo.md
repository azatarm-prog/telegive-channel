# Channel Service Database Sync Fix - TODO

## Phase 3: Test the fixes and verify database connectivity

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Updated app.py get_bot_credentials function to use direct database access
- [x] Updated channels.py get_bot_credentials function to use direct database access
- [x] Removed Auth Service API calls from channels.py
- [x] Updated all route functions to clarify that account_id parameter is actually bot_id
- [x] Added parameter validation to ensure account_id is treated as bot_id
- [x] Updated function documentation to clarify bot_id vs account_id usage
- [x] Created comprehensive test scripts for account lookup logic
- [x] Verified all API logic works correctly with mocked data
- [x] Confirmed integration flow is properly designed

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Deploy and test the fixed service in production environment

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the changes
- [ ] Verify account lookup works with real shared database (production only)
- [ ] Update error messages to be more specific about bot_id vs account_id

## Test Results ‚úÖ
- **Account Lookup Logic**: All tests passed with mocked database
- **API Route Logic**: Correctly handles bot_id 262662172
- **Integration Flow**: Properly designed for direct database access
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate messages for missing accounts/channels

## Key Issue Resolved ‚úÖ
The routes now correctly use `account_id` parameter as `bot_id` (262662172).
The database lookup uses this bot_id to find the account record.
All Auth Service API calls have been removed in favor of direct database access.

## Database Schema Understanding ‚úÖ
- accounts table has both `id` (primary key = 1) and `bot_id` (Telegram ID = 262662172)
- Channel Service now uses `bot_id` for lookups, not `id`
- ChannelConfig.account_id stores the bot_id (262662172), not the database primary key
- Direct database queries replace Auth Service API calls
